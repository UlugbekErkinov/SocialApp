> learned how to build an authentication system into site
I implemented all the necessary views for users to register, log in, log out,
edit their password, and reset their password. I built a model for custom user
profiles and you created a custom authentication backend to let users log in to 
a site using their email address. I also added social authentication to a
site so that users can use their existing Facebook, Twitter, or Google account
to log in.
